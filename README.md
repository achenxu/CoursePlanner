# CoursePlanner
CoursePlanner is an open source tool to parse course information and help plan a schedule for next semester.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need python 2.7.13 installed on your machine.
Since it is a script at this stage, we don't need anything else installed yet.
We are running the scripts through the terminal.

### Running

Open up the terminal and cd into the project directory

```
cd <CoursePlanner folder>
```
Then run the script, it will put classes and info in a .csv file
```
python Script.py
```

Check the .csv file afterwards.
